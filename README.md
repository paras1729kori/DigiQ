## Description

A Digital Queuing System.
It works in unison with an android application, developed along with a team.

My Team:

2. [Sarvesh Soni](https://github.com/SarveshSoni09)
3. [Manasvi Sabnis](https://github.com/ManasviSabnis)

Motive of making such a system:

- Hassle free interaction of a queue
- No physical presence needed
- Saving a considerable amount of time
